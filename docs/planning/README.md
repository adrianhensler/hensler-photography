# Planning Documents (Private)

Detailed product and session planning files have been moved to private storage to keep operational notes and credentials out of the public repository. The public roadmap is maintained separately in `docs/ROADMAP_PUBLIC.md` with high-level milestones and feature releases.

Operational playbooks that must stay public (for example, the Git workflow used to avoid divergent branches) now live under `docs/guides/` so they remain accessible to on-call engineers while sprint-by-sprint planning stays private.

For contributors with access to the private planning space, please consult the internal documentation store for the latest sprint notes, retrospectives, and work-in-progress specifications.
